### Section 18: Day 17 - Movie App

This page requires an API key for [The Movies Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/).  
Please make sure, that you have a valid [API key](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api), and place it in the header of the page.

It's not a safe practise to upload secret API keys here, but I'm planning to build a back-end version of this project that can store my key safely.
